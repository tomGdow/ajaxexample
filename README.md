## Ajax Examples
Two basic Ajax examples are given. 

1.  Ajax is used to to asynchronously insert HTML (‘test.html’) 
    into a web page

2. Ajax is used to synchronously retrieve data from an XML file   
(‘xmlfile.xml’) and asynchronously display them on a HTML page.

The examples were developed with the Ruby-on-Rails framwork, but of  
course there is no need to do this. 

They are based on the code given by [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX) at  
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started
